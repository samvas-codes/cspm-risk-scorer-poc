# CSPM Risk Scorer PoC

A heuristic risk scorer for cloud assets leveraging MITRE ATT&CK mappings and tags to evaluate and score risks. This tool helps in identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities within cloud environments.

## Key Features
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mappings**: Integration with the globally-recognized framework to standardize threat assessment.
- **Tag-Based Scoring**: Contextual risk scoring based on predefined tags, allowing for detailed analysis.
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Uses heuristic methods to evaluate cloud configurations for potential security risks.

## Benefits
- **Risk Prioritization**: Score-based prioritization aids in focusing on the most critical vulnerabilities.
- **Contextual Insights**: Provides a nuanced understanding of security postures through contextual tagging and analysis.
- **Integration with Existing Frameworks**: Standardized approach compatible with organizations already using MITRE ATT&CK.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and follow setup instructions in the README file.
2. **Configuration**: Use the synthetic data or modeul your own cloud assets to appropriate MITRE ATT&CK techniques and define scoring heuristics.
3. **Running the Tool**: Execute the tool to generate and review risk scores for assets.
4. **To Run the Tool**: streamlit run risk-score-gen.py

## Conclusion
The CSPM Risk Scorer PoC is an PoC tool for any organization looking to enhance its security posture by systematically assessing and prioritizing risks within their cloud environments. Utilize this tool to gain greater control over potential vulnerabilities, ensuring a more secure cloud infrastructure.
